Using both a 2D Array and a struct, this provides the user with a November 2023 and a December 2023 Lunar Calendar. The user is given the option in the menu to choose a specific month or week (or both months provided) to see the phases along with the days. 
The user is also given thee often to sort the calendar based on the smallest -> greatest or greatest -> smallest illumination periods. 
The user may also remove a week from the calendar or display astronomical or astrological information for November & December.
